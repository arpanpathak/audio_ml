# Audio/Music Information Retrieval and Machine Learning
> This Project is a MonoRepo which contains all the Audio `Exploratory Data Analysis (E.D.A)` and
> Machine Learning Models along with cited DataSets.

> This project will also hold Distributed Partitioned Streamable DataSets generated by after experiments

*`NOTE: Models and Training snapshots,algorithms are kept private. Use the methods described in correcponding sections to stream the data sets from `kaggle` or multiple cloud storages `*

## DataSets
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpanpathak/original-and-cover-song-pairs 

### About Dataset
This dataset contains 80 pairs of song and their cover.
These RAW wav files ares sourced from ISMIR webscrapping.
https://www.ismir.net/resources/datasets/

Each of the songs in the pair is organized in a directory same as the name of the song title.

Download and extract the archive and read the README.md for covers80 package

This is a set of data and code to support the MIREX cover song 
identification task.

The directory covers32k/ contains 80 songs with two versions of 
each, all encoded as 32 kbps MP3 (mono, 16k sampling, bandwidth 
limited to 7 kHz). The basis of this set was cover versions .
